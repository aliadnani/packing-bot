Dr. David Navarro-Alarcon Recommendation Letter

To Whom It May Concern:

It is with my greatest pleasure in writing this letter to recommend Mr. Ali Adnan Imran for graduate studies at your university.

I first met Ali when he wrote me an email asking to be a part of the robotics and machine intelligence lab I run. He showed great proactiveness and passion for the field of robotics in the subsequent meeting we had where we discussed the sorts of work and research we do at the lab. Thus I brought him on to our research team and assigned him to work on our semi-autonomous welding project shortly after. 

Throughout the course of the semester as I supervised his work, he demonstrated excellent critical thinking and problem solving skills, he was able to bring in ideas from different fields of academia and apply them in novel ways in his own work. The trait I was most impressed with was his programming ability; it was exceptional and very rarely seen from students studying engineering; his level was comparable to those studying pure computer science. 

His time was also very well managed. During the first meeting we had, I had some concerns knowing that he was a final year student that was dealing with a bachelor’s thesis and numerous difficult final year electives he had enrolled. These concerns quickly went away when he continued to produce great results despite his busy schedule.

From a non-technical standpoint, Ali has great communication skills and works very well in a team - integrating seamlessly with people from different backgrounds throughout all his projects. 

Overall, Ali is a very proactive, intelligent and determined student. I would be happy to collaborate with him again in the future. I believe with all confidence that he will do an excellent job in whichever life path he decides to take in the future and I sincerely wish him all the best in his professional endeavor. If any further clarification on his background and qualifications is required, please feel free to contact me.

Yours Faithfully
